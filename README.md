# -Smart-Healthcare-Management-System-KU
Group project for System Analysis &amp; Software Design course in Khalifa University 



This project aims to develop a Smart Healthcare Management System (SHMS), which will integrate
various features for managing patients, doctors, and hospital administration, along with real-time data
collection through wearable devices. The system should incorporate a patient portal, doctor-patient
appointment scheduling, real-time monitoring of patient vitals (simulated), and predictive analysis for patient
health using machine learning algorithms. This project will require advanced system analysis, complex
design patterns, and the implementation of various subsystems, making it more challenging than typical
projects like LMS.


The Project will be made using flutter for developing both mobile and web interface and esp32 microcontroller to send data and display it for idk why
